# OOP C++ Practice Assignments

## 📘 Introduction
Welcome to my repository of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** assignments and practice exercises in **C++**. These problems are part of my engineering coursework and have been carefully selected to help me develop a deep understanding of OOP principles and apply them in real-world programming.

## 📚 Topics Covered
This repository includes various assignments that focus on key OOP concepts, including but not limited to:

- **Classes and Objects**
- **Constructors and Destructors**
- **Inheritance** (Single, Multilevel, Multiple, Hierarchical)
- **Polymorphism** (Compile-time & Run-time)
- **Function Overloading**
- **Operator Overloading**
- **File Handling**
- **Friend Functions**
- **Static Members**
- **Exception Handling**
- **Access Specifiers** (Private, Public, Protected)
- **Dynamic Memory Management**

## 🧠 Assignment Overview
Each `.cpp` file corresponds to a specific coding question, and within each file, you'll find the problem statement along with the implemented solution. The goal of these exercises is to enhance my knowledge of OOP principles through practical coding challenges.

Some of the key topics covered are:

- **Problem Solving with OOP:** Focusing on how to model real-world scenarios using classes and objects.
- **Advanced Features:** Handling complex scenarios involving inheritance, polymorphism, and operator overloading.
- **Practical Applications:** File handling, exception handling, and other useful utilities in OOP.

> 📝 **Note:** All problem descriptions are included within the comments of each `.cpp` file, making it easier to follow along.
